We will be focusing on software quality (scalability, readability, maintainability, etc.) and your eye for detail. You may include any libraries, but Vue.js is preferred and jQuery is not recommended. Along with following best practices, bonus points for following our [coding guidelines](https://github.com/mindarc/frontend-assessment/wiki/Coding-guidelines).",
